<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Homework Problem Set 10: Statistical Tests
Concerning <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></h1>

</div>


<p>You can also download a <a href="homework-10.pdf">PDF</a> copy of
this homework assignment.</p>
<p>Instructions: These homework problems will help familiarize you with
the process of conducting a statistical test concerning the parameter
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. For each problem conduct all
five steps of the statistical test (state the hypotheses, check the
sample size, compute the test statistic, compute the p-value, and make a
decision). Also note that you will need to use <a
href="https://www.statdistributions.com">statdistributions.com</a> to
compute p-values. The solutions are given at the end.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="extra-sensory-perception" class="section level2">
<h2>Extra Sensory Perception</h2>
<p>Recall from previous homework assignments the method for testing for
extra sensory perception (ESP) using Zener cards. Assume the deck
contains 25 cards — five cards of each of five different symbols as
shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="zenercards.jpg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
To test a subject for ESP, the deck is first shuffled and then the
experimenter selects a card, studies it, but does not show it to the
subject. The subject is then asked to read/guess the symbol on the card.
This process is repeated until the deck is exhausted, although it can be
repeated as many times as desired. The subject is not told until the end
if and when they were correct or incorrect so that they cannot “count
cards” to improve their chance of guessing later cards in a deck. The
distribution of a <em>single observation</em> (i.e., the <em>population
distribution</em>) is given in the table below.
<table class="table table-hover" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">

<th style="text-align:center;">

<tbody>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">
incorrect
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
<span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That is, a subject will correctly read/guess a card with probability
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and incorrectly read/guess the
card with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span>. Note
that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is unknown <em>unless</em>
we assume that a subject does not have ESP and can only guess the
card.</p>
The table below shows the results from testing four subjects. Each row
shows the name of the subject, the number of times they correctly
read/guessed the card, and the number of cards used (e.g., Frodo guessed
the correct card 12 times out of a total of 50 cards).

<p>Suppose we want to determine for each subject if there is any
evidence that they have some capacity for ESP, which would be
demonstrated by showing that their probability of a correct response
(i.e., <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) exceeds that of guessing.
Conduct a statistical test concerning <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for each subject to determine if they
are guessing or actually posses some capacity for ESP. Use a
significance level of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> =
0.01. (Hint: This problem is similar to the Pounce game example
discussed in lecture, except rather than there being three words to
choose from there are five symbols.)</p>

<div id="vegemite-and-marmite-as-foot-hair-softeners"
class="section level2">
<h2>Vegemite and Marmite as Foot Hair Softeners</h2>
<p>Researchers conducted a study to compare the effects of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite">Vegemite</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite">Marmite</a> as foot hair
softeners for Hobbits. For each of 100 Hobbits they selected one foot at
random to which to apply Vegemite. Marmite was applied to the other
foot. This was done every day for a week. Afterwards each Hobbit was
asked which foot they thought had softer hair. Forty Hobbits thought
that the foot to which Vegemite was applied had softer hair. Let <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> denote the probability that a Hobbit
will decide that Vegemite resulted in softer hair than Marmite. If one
substance is more effective than the other then there should be a higher
than chance probability that the foot with that substance would be
selected. Conduct a statistical test to determine to determine if there
is evidence that one substance tends to soften foot hair more than the
other. Use a significance level of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.05.</p>

<div id="mendelian-inheritance" class="section level2">
<h2>Mendelian Inheritance</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Gregor
Mendel</a> was a 19th century Augustinian friar who conducted
experiments with pea plants to investigating heredity. In one classic
experiment he bred pea plants by crossing plants from a strain that only
produced green peas with another strain that only produced yellow peas.
The first-generation offspring from this crossbreeding then produced a
strain of pea plants that were presumed to carried the genes for both
yellow and green peas — one from each parent. However these plants only
had yellow seeds because it was assumed that the yellow genes are
<em>dominant</em> in the sense that an offspring with at least one gene
for yellow peas will always have yellow peas. The only way for a plant
to have green peas is if both genes were for green peas. The plants from
the first-generation offspring were then crossed with themselves to
produce the second-generation offspring. Mendel hypothesized that the
probability of a second-generation offspring having green peas is 0.25
based on specific assumptions about how inheritance works for that
particular trait. But if Mendel was wrong then the probability of
offspring with green peas would not be 0.25. To test his conjecture
Mendel bred 8023 second-generation offspring, of which 2006 were found
to be green. Use a statistical test with a significance level of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.01 based on Mendel’s
hypothesis.</p>
<p>Note: Usually it is the <em>alternative</em> hypothesis is what is
predicted by scientific theory. This example is an exception because
Mendel’s theory of inheritance implies the null hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="twirler-mice" class="section level2">
<h2>Twirler Mice</h2>
<p>The kinds of inheritance mechanisms that Mendel hypothesized for
plants are sometimes found in animals and humans, but not all traits are
inherited in this way. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_F._Lyon">Mary Lyon</a>
investigated if the trait of “twirling” in “twirler mice” exhibited
Mendelian inheritance.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> A twirler mouse exhibits a behavior of
shaking their head horizontally and circling. Lyon conducted a study
similar to design to Mendel’s pea study, but with mice. She raised 142
second-generation mice, of which 84 exhibited the twirling trait.
Mendelian inheritance would hypothesize that the probability that a
second-generation offspring would have the twirling trait is 0.75, but
if the trait does not exhibit Mendelian inheritance then the probability
would be something else. Use a statistical test with a significance
level of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.05 based on the
hypothesis that twirling in twirler mice exhibits Mendelian
inheritance.</p>

</div>
<div id="tests-for-extra-sensory-perception-solutions"
class="section level2">
<h2>Tests for Extra Sensory Perception (Solutions)</h2>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses for each subject will be the
same. They are <span class="math inline">\(H_0\!: p = 0.2\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(H_a\!: p &gt; 0.2\)</span>. Although we
could consider using <span class="math inline">\(H_a: p \neq
0.2\)</span>, it seems more reasonable to assume that <span
class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.2\)</span> if the null is false since if
they are not guessing then the probability of being correct would be
higher than chance. Checking the sample sizes shows that the sample
sizes are not quite large enough when only two decks (i.e, 50 cards) is
used. However we will proceed with the test anyway. The value of the
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> test statistic for each subject
is 0.71, 1.77, 1, 2.5, respectively. The <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values are then 0.24, 0.039, 0.159,
0.006, respectively. Based on these <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values and a significance level of
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.01\)</span>, we would reject the
null hypothesis for fourth subject, but not the other three subjects.
Thus we would conclude that the only subject for which the proportion of
correct responses is significantly higher than chance is the fourth
subject.</p>
</div>
<div id="vegemite-and-marmite-as-hair-softeners-solutions"
class="section level2">
<h2>Vegemite and Marmite as Hair Softeners (Solutions)</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> denote the probability
that Vegemite will result in (perceived) softer hair than Marmite for a
given Hobbit. If neither substance is better than the other, on average,
then <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.5\)</span>. Alternatively if
Vegemite is better than Marmite then <span class="math inline">\(p &gt;
0.5\)</span>, but if Marmite is better than Vegemite then <span
class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.5\)</span>. We do not have any idea a
priori if one substance might be better than the other so a two-sided
tests seems reasonable with hypotheses <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\!: p = 0.5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H_a\!: p \neq 0.5\)</span>. The sample size is
sufficiently large for the test. The test statistic is <span
class="math inline">\(z = -2\)</span>. This yields a p-value of about
0.046. Based on a significance level of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> we would reject the null
hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significance
difference in the effectiveness of the two hair softeners.</p>
</div>
<div id="mendelian-inheritance-solutions" class="section level2">
<h2>Mendelian Inheritance (Solutions)</h2>
<p>Here we let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> denote the
probability of a green offspring and specify the hypotheses <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\!: p = 0.25\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H_a\!: p \neq 0.25\)</span>. A two-sided test is
appropriate here because there is no information about whether <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> may be smaller or larger than 0.25 in
the case where the null hypothesis is false. The sample size of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 8023 is quite adequate for the test.
The value of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> test statistic
is about 0.01. This yields a p-value of about 0.995. (Note: If we
considered instead the probability of a <em>yellow</em> offspring so
that <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p = 0.75\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(H_a: p \neq 0.75\)</span>. This would have
resulted in the same value of the test statistic where <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = (8023-2006)/8023\)</span>, except with
the opposite sign, and the same p-value, and thus the same conclusion.)
Based on a significance level of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.01 we would not reject the
null hypothesis that the probability of producing a green offspring is
0.25 and conclude that the proportion of green (or yellow) peas is not
statistically significant.</p>
</div>
<div id="twirler-mice-solutions" class="section level2">
<h2>Twirler Mice (Solutions)</h2>
<p>Here we let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be the probability
that second-generation offspring has the twirling trait. The null
hypotehsis would be <span class="math inline">\(H_0\!: p = 0.75\)</span>
and the alterantive hypothesis would be <span
class="math inline">\(H_a\!: p \neq 0.75\)</span>. A two-sided test is
appropriate here because there is no information about whether <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> may be smaller or larger than 0.75 in
the case where the null hypothesis is false. The sample size of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 142 is adequate for the test. The
value of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> test statistic is
approximately -4.36. This yields a p-value of approximately 0. Based on
a significance level of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> =
0.05 we would reject the null hypothesis that the probability of a
second-generation offspring having the twirler trait is 0.75 and
conclude that the proportion of twirler mice is statistically
significant.</p>
