<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Syllabus for Statistical Methods (Stat
251)</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">Section 02 (Johnson), Spring 2023</h3>

</div>


<p>You can <a href="syllabus.pdf">download a PDF version</a> of this
syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>Instructor</strong>: Dr. Timothy R. Johnson, Professor of
Statistics, Department of Mathematics and Statistical Science. Email: <a
href="mailto:trjohns@uidaho.edu" class="email">trjohns@uidaho.edu</a>.
Office phone: 208-885-2928. Department phone: 208-885-6742. My office is
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zcpTXzbPCGWGj7tM9">Brink 417</a> and my
office hours are 10:30 to 11:20 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I
am available to meet other times. You are welcome to make an appointment
or drop-in without an appointment. I can also meet over Zoom.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong>: The learning outcomes for this
course are a familiarity with the concepts of statistical description,
statistical inference (including estimation, confidence intervals,
statistical tests, and prediction), and the relationship between design
and inference. Students should become familiar with specific methods for
inferences concerning means and proportions for one- and two-sample
designs, and some methods for bivariate data including contingency
tables, correlation, and regression. Students should also gain an
understanding of some of the underlying theoretical foundations of
statistical inference including probability theory, random variables,
and sampling distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: One of the following: Math 143 (with
grade of ‘C’ or better), Math 160, Math 170, or sufficient score on SAT,
ACT, or math placement test (see <a
href="http://www.uidaho.edu/registrar/registration/placement">www.uidaho.edu/registrar/registration/placement</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: There is no textbook. Lectures and lecture
notes will be your source of material. For those who would like to
consult a textbook there are some free books available online such as <a
href="https://www.openintro.org/stat">OpenIntro Statistics</a>. But all
material for which you are responsible will be covered in lecture.</p>
<p><strong>Course Website</strong>: Most course materials including
lecture notes, homework assignments, study guides, this syllabus, and
other materials can be found on the course website <a
href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat251">trobinj.github.io/stat251</a>.
Note that this is separate from <a
href="http://canvas.uidaho.edu">Canvas</a>, which will only be used for
examination scores. Canvas does have a link to the course website.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Class attendance is required. Excluding
holidays and examination days there are 39 days of lecture. You are
permitted to miss up to four days of lecture with no penalty, so your
attendance will be computed as the proportion of days attending out of a
total of 35 days. You may miss additional days without penalty only for
documented university events or extreme circumstances. If you cannot
attend your courses due to a health-related issue or family emergency,
you should file a <a
href="https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/vandalcare">VandalCare
Report</a> or contact the <a
href="https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students">Dean of
Students</a> so that the university can document your absence and
contract your instructors. If you are not engaged in class (e.g.,
sleeping, using your phone/computer) you may not be awarded attendance,
and you may not be awarded attendance if you arrive to class late or
leave early. So that attendance can be reliably recorded, you will have
assigned seats after the first week of class. You must sit in your
assigned seat starting the second week of class, although you may ask to
have your assigned seat changed during the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: Homework assignments be made available
periodically on the <a href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat251">course
website</a> (see the <a
href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat251/lectures">lectures</a> section).
Homework assignments will <em>not</em> be collected/graded. Some
computational problems in the examinations are based on homework
problems (although the numbers may be changed) so it is highly
recommended that you have worked through the homework problems before
each examination in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Examinations</strong>: There are six examinations (not
including the final examination). The dates of these examinations are
1/27, 2/13, 3/3, 3/27, 4/12, and 4/28. These dates may be postponed if
unforeseen circumstances delay progression through the material in
lecture. You will have the full class period (50 minutes) for each
examination. The question formats are multiple choice and short answer.
A page of formulas will be provided with each examination, but the
formulas will not be labeled. You are permitted to use one page of notes
during the examinations (8.5 by 11 inches maximum, writing on both sides
is fine). Calculators are permitted (and sometimes necessary), but must
not be capable of wireless communication. Notes and calculators used
during the examination may not be shared. Study guides for examinations
will be made available on the course website in the <a
href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat251/lectures.html">lectures
section</a> typically two lecture days before the examination. Make-ups
for missed examinations will only be permitted for documented university
sanctioned events or in extreme circumstances. Notice of a missed
examination due to a foreseeable absence must be given <em>at least one
week before</em> the scheduled day of the examination. Notice of a
missed examination due to unforeseeable absence must be made <em>before
the end of the day</em> for which the examination was scheduled. If I
contact you to schedule a make-up a examination you must respond
<em>promptly</em> (i.e., the same day) or you may not be able to make up
the examination.</p>
<p><strong>Final Examination</strong>: The final examination is on
Tuesday, May 9th, from 10:15 AM to 12:15 PM. The final examination may
not be taken at another time unless, as according to university policy,
you have more than two final examinations on that day, or a conflict
with a documented university sanctioned event. The amount of time
permitted to complete the final examination is two hours (120 minutes).
The final examination is like that of the other examinations except that
it is comprehensive and longer. A study guide for the final examination
will be made available. Policies regarding the first six examinations
also apply to the final examination, except that you are permitted to
use up to five pages of notes for the final examination (8.5 by 11
inches maximum, writing on both sides is fine).</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: The first six examinations altogether are
worth 70% of your course grade. Your lowest score of these six
examinations will be dropped when grades are determined. The remaining
five examinations are thus each worth 15% of your course grade. The
final examination is worth 20% of your course grade. The final
examination may not be dropped. Attendance is worth 10% of your grade.
Letter grades for the course will be assigned according to the following
rubric: A (87.5%-100%), B (75%-87.5%), C (62.5%-75%), D (50%-62.5%), F
(less than 50%). Course grades are based solely on the examination
scores and the grading rubric described above. Changes to the grading
system (e.g., the grade rubric or the weights) will not result in any
students getting a lower letter grade than that obtained using the
system described above.</p>
<p><strong>Tutoring</strong>: The Statistics Assistance Center (SAC) is
a free drop-in tutoring service located in the library. See <a
href="http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/stat/about/sac">www.uidaho.edu/sci/stat/about/sac</a>
for more information. Tutoring is also available through Academic
Support Programs. See <a
href="https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/academic-support/asp/tcs/tutoring">www.uidaho.edu/current-students/academic-support/asp/tcs/tutoring</a>
for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong>: You are responsible for being
aware of the policies of the University of Idaho on academic honesty.
See Section A-1 of Article II of the <a
href="http://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/student-conduct/student-code-of-conduct">Student
Code of Conduct</a>. This includes but is not limited to cheating,
facilitation of cheating, and furnishing false information or false
representation. Breaches of academic honesty will not be tolerated, and
will result in a F for the course and referral to the Dean of Students
for further disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Disability Access</strong>: The University of Idaho is
committed to ensuring an accessible learning environment where course or
instructional content are usable by all students and faculty. If you
believe that you require disability-related academic adjustments for
this class (including pregnancy-related disabilities), please contact
the Center for Disability Access and Resources (CDAR) to discuss
eligibility. A current accommodation letter from CDAR is required before
any modifications, above and beyond what is otherwise available for all
other students in this class, will be provided. Please be advised that
disability-related academic adjustments are not retroactive. CDAR is
located at the Bruce Pitman Building, Suite 127. Phone is 208-885-6307
and e-mail is <a href="mailto:cdar@uidaho.edu"
class="email">cdar@uidaho.edu</a>. For a listing of services and current
business hours visit <a
href="https://www.uidaho.edu/cdar">www.uidaho.edu/cdar</a></p>
<p><strong>Title IX</strong>: University of Idaho is committed to
creating a safe learning environment for all students. Consistent with
this, UI policy and Title IX prohibit sexual misconduct, which includes
sex or gender based harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner
violence, stalking, and retaliation. If you have experienced any form of
sexual misconduct, know that help and support are available. Please be
aware that all University of Idaho employees are mandatory reporters and
are required to report any information they receive about sexual
misconduct to the university’s Title IX Coordinator within 24 hours
