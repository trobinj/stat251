Samples</h1>

</div>


<p>You can also download a <a href="homework-14.pdf">PDF</a> copy of
this homework assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong>: These homework problems will help
familiarize you with how we can make inferences concerning the
difference between two means (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1 -
\mu_2\)</span>). For statistical tests state appropriate null and
alternative hypotheses, compute the test statistic, compute the p-value,
and make a decision/conclusion. Use a significance level of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.05. For confidence intervals
use a confidence level of 95%. The solutions are given at the end.<a

<h2>Bumpus’ Sparrows</h2>
<p>A famous <a
href="https://amornithhistory.org/2018/03/05/professor-bumpus-and-his-sparrows">lecture</a>
by biologist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermon_Carey_Bumpus">Hermon
Bumpus</a> demonstrated natural selection using data concerning the
survival of house sparrows (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) after a severe
winter storm.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After the storm moribund sparrows were
brought to the Anatomical Laboratory at Brown University. Some of these
sparrows were revived, but many died. All of the sparrows that were
brought in were examined with respect to a variety of anatomical
characteristics. It is interesting to compare the anatomical
characteristics of sparrows that survived versus those that did not. The
distributions of humerus (upper wing bone) length in the samples of
sparrows that survived and the sparrows that did not are shown below.
<img src="homework-14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Of the sample of 72 observations for sparrows that survived, the mean
humerus length was 0.74 in, and the standard deviation was 0.02 in. And
of the sample of 64 observations for sparrows that died, the mean
humerus length was 0.73 in, and the standard deviation was 0.03 in. Let
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_s\)</span> denote the mean for the
population distribution of humerus length for sparrows that would
survive, and let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_d\)</span> denote the
mean for the population distribution of humerus length for sparrows that
would not survive. Bumpus would probably have pointed out that sparrows
that survived tended to have a larger humerus length than those that did
not. While this is true for his samples, it is not clear if we can infer
from this that this is true <em>in general</em> (i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_s &gt; \mu_d\)</span>). Conduct a statistical
test to determine if the difference in the sample means is statistically
significant or not using the hypotheses <span class="math inline">\(H_0:
\mu_s-\mu_d = 0\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(H_a:
\mu_s-\mu_d &gt; 0\)</span>. Also estimate the difference in mean
humerus length (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_s-\mu_d\)</span>) using
a confidence interval.</p>

<div id="experimental-investigation-of-the-peak-end-rule"
class="section level2">
<h2>Experimental Investigation of the Peak-End Rule</h2>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak-end_rule">peak-end
rule</a> is a psychological heuristic where people tend to judge an
experience disproportionately based on how the felt at the <em>peak</em>
of the experience (i.e., at the point of maximum pleasure or
pain/discomfort) and at the <em>end</em> of the experience. The
phenomenon has many implications and potential applications. Do, Rupert,
and Wolford (2008) conducted randomized experiments that demonstrate the
peak-end rule.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In one experiment subjects were contacted
by email to tell them they had won a raffle they had entered after
making a donation in a fundraiser. The fundraiser was a real but the
“raffle” was organized by the researchers for the purpose of the study.
Subjects that replied were randomly assigned to one of two treatment
conditions. The reward for the raffle was to select a DVD from one or
both of two lists. List <em>A</em> consisted of 10 movies that were all
highly rated. List <em>B</em> consisted of a different 10 movies that
were not so highly rated. In one treatment condition the subjects were
first allowed to pick a movie from list <em>A</em>, and were then
contacted in another email and allowed to select a movie from list
<em>B</em> (denote this treatment condition as “<em>A+B</em>”). In the
other treatment condition the subjects were only allowed to pick from
list <em>A</em> (let this treatment condition be denoted simply as
“<em>A</em>”). After selecting their DVD(s), subjects were contacted
again by email and asked to rate the overall experience on an integer
scale from 1 (least pleased) to 7 (most pleased). Of the 21 subjects who
selected movies from both list <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, the mean
rating was 4.14 and the standard deviation was 1.19, but of the 29
subjects who selected movies from only list <em>A</em>, the mean rating
was 5.21 and the standard deviation was 0.92. The sample sizes, means,
and standard deviations (SD) are also shown in the table below.

<p>While objectively the <em>A+B</em> treatment condition rewards the
subjects more, it has a less pleasurable end than the <em>A</em>
treatment condition, which may lead people to tend to perceive the
experience in <em>A</em> to be more pleasurable than that in
<em>A+B</em>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{ab}\)</span> denote the mean for two
hypothetical population distributions of observations of ratings
corresponding to the <em>A</em> and <em>A+B</em> treatment conditions,
respectively. Conduct a statistical test with the alternative hypothesis
that the peak-end rule results in higher ratings, on average, for
treatment condition <em>A</em> than for treatment condition <em>A+B</em>
(i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\mu_a &gt; \mu_{ab}\)</span>).</p>

<h2>Age of Onset of Schizophrenia</h2>
<p>The German psychiatrist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Kraepelin">Emil Kraepelin</a>
published one of the early scientific treatments of what was at the time
(incorrectly) labelled <em>dementia praecox</em> (i.e., premature
dementia) but what later became known as schizophrenia.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Some data from that
work shows the age of onset in some women and men who had been diagnosed
with dementia praecox.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> These data are shown in the figure below.
<img src="homework-14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
For the sample of 99 women, the mean age of onset was 30.5 years and the
standard deviation was 11.7 years. And for the sample of 152 men, the
mean age of onset was 23.9 years and the standard deviation was 8.6
years. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_w\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_m\)</span> represent the mean for the
population distributions of age of onset for women and men,

<h2>Reproductive Success of Polyandrous Female Pseudoscorpions</h2>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscorpion">Pseudoscorpions</a>
(<em>Cordylochernes scorpioides</em>) are not scorpions but rather an
arachnid that looks somewhat like a scorpion but without the segmented
tail and stinger. A study by Newcomer, Zeh, and Zeh (1999) investigated
the effects of polyandry on the reproductive success of female
pseudoscorpions.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Each of 36 female pseudoscorpions was
randomly put into one of two groups. In one group the females each
received two sperm packets from two <em>different</em> males, while in
the other group the females received two sperm packets from the
<em>same</em> male. The number of brood sacs (an external container of
embryos) later produced by each female was counted. The researchers
wanted to determine if the genetic benefits of receiving sperm packets
from different males (as opposed to the same amount of sperm from one
male) would result in greater reproductive success as quantified by the
number of brood sacs produced.
<img src="homework-14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The average number of successful broods produced by females that
received sperm from two <em>different</em> males was 3.62 brood sacs in
comparison to 2.2 brood sacs produced by females that received sperm
from the <em>same</em> male. The standard deviations were similar
between the two treatments: 1.96 brood sacs for the females that
received sperm from different males and 1.61 brood sacs for the females
that received sperm from the same male. Conduct a statistical test to
determine if there is evidence that females that receive sperm packets
from two different males produce more brood sacs, on average, than
females that receive the same number of sperm packs from the same male.
